House Price Prediction Model Task 1 Bharat Intern

This repository contains the code for a house price prediction model trained on the California house price dataset. The model uses two methods: linear regression and random forest.

### Technologies Used

* Python
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn

### Model Description

The model is trained on a dataset of California house prices, which includes features such as, number of bedrooms, and location. The model can be used to predict the price of a new house based on its features.

### Methods Used

* **Linear Regression:** This is a simple method that assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable (house price).
* **Random Forest:** This is a more complex method that uses an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions.
